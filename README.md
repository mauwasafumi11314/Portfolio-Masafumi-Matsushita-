# Description
This study assesses groundwater vulnerability to nitrate and arsenic contamination in the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia, using standardized models across three seasonal scenarios. Environmental parameters were analyzed in ArcGIS, with model robustness tested through map removal sensitivity analysis and validated using the Kendall rank coefficient test. Results indicated a significant correlation between the models and nitrate concentration, with risk classification maps showing a linear trend between higher risk levels and samples exceeding nitrate concentration thresholds. The standardized models demonstrated potential for predicting areas vulnerable to nitrate contamination above 5 mg/L, 25 mg/L, and 50 mg/L.
The following code scripts were used for automating map removal sensitivity analysis and storing its outputs in a table
